This is a python codebase


Create a Bot with botfather and take the token
Create a channeal/group and add this botfather and get the chatid

you can set the token of bot in the config.py
and the channel id in the config.py


sec-key in config.py is needed to be used in the webook

1. u can run it by python main.py

u can send webook with http://localhost:5000/<sec-key>/webhook


If u want to connect it to tradingview u need to deploy it to heroku or some external server per ur choice

i uploaded code to github and run it from heroku after creating id
(u can google and find out how to do it)

once u run in heroku you will get a url on which the bot will run u can then use it in tradingiview

<url from heroku>/<sec-key u mentioned in config/webhook 

and send a message in the body of alert.


Thats all

Best of luck
